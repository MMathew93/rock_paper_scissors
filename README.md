Started actual oroject today. I am struggling with my functions as they are working in chrome, but refuse to do so in fire fox advising they are undefined. I sturggle with console logging functions to ensure their working.
I added a prompt for funsies and finished the computer selection. Trying to do player selection next and will have the outcomes for a round set afterwards.
